<p>Oh, here in the shop the machines roar so wildly,<br>
That oft, unaware that I am, or have been,<br>
I sink and am lost in the terrible tumult;<br>
And void is my soul... I am but a machine.<br>
I work and I work and I work, never ceasing;<br>
Create and create things from morning till e&rsquo;en;<br>
For what?&mdash;and for whom&mdash;Oh, I know not! Oh, ask not!<br>
Who ever has heard of a conscious machine?</p>

<p>No, here is no feeling, no thought and no reason;<br>
This life-crushing labor has ever supprest<br>
The noblest and finest, the truest and richest,<br>
The deepest, the highest and humanly best.<br>
The seconds, the minutes, they pass out forever,<br>
They vanish, swift fleeting like straws in a gale.<br>
I drive the wheel madly as tho&rsquo; to o&rsquo;ertake them,&mdash;<br>
Give chase without wisdom, or wit, or avail.</p>

<p>The clock in the workshop,&mdash;it rests not a moment;<br>
It points on, and ticks on: Eternity&mdash;Time;<br>
And once someone told me the clock had a meaning,&mdash;<br>
Its pointing and ticking had reason and rhyme.<br>
And this too he told me,&mdash;or had I been dreaming,&mdash;<br>
The clock wakened life in one, forces unseen,<br>
And something besides;... I forget what; Oh, ask not!<br>
I know not, I know not, I am a machine.</p>

<p>At times, when I listen, I hear the clock plainly;&mdash;<br>
The reason of old&mdash;the old meaning&mdash;is gone!<br>
The maddening pendulum urges me forward<br>
To labor and labor and still labor on.<br>
The tick of the clock is the Boss in his anger!<br>
The face of the clock has the eyes of a foe;<br>
The clock&mdash;Oh, I shudder&mdash;dost hear how it drives me?<br>
It calls me &ldquo;Machine!&rdquo; and it cries to me &ldquo;Sew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At noon, when about me the wild tumult ceases,<br>
And gone is the master, and I sit apart,<br>
And dawn in my brain is beginning to glimmer,<br>
The wound comes agape at the core of my heart;<br>
And tears, bitter tears flow; ay, tears that are scalding;<br>
They moisten my dinner&mdash;my dry crust of bread;<br>
They choke me,&mdash;I cannot eat;&mdash;no, no, I cannot!<br>
Oh, horrible toil I born of Need and of Dread.</p>

<p>The sweatshop at mid-day&mdash;I&rsquo;ll draw you the picture:<br>
A battlefield bloody; the conflict at rest;<br>
Around and about me the corpses are lying;<br>
The blood cries aloud from the earth&rsquo;s gory breast.<br>
A moment... and hark! The loud signal is sounded,<br>
The dead rise again and renewed is the fight...<br>
They struggle, these corpses; for strangers, for strangers!<br>
They struggle, they fall, and they sink into night.</p>

<p>I gaze on the battle in bitterest anger,<br>
And pain, hellish pain wakes the rebel in me!<br>
The clock&mdash;now I hear it aright!&mdash;It is crying:<br>
&ldquo;An end to this bondage! An end there must be!&rdquo;<br>
It quickens my reason, each feeling within me;<br>
It shows me how precious the moments that fly.<br>
Oh, worthless my life if I longer am silent,<br>
And lost to the world if in silence I die.</p>

<p>The man in me sleeping begins to awaken;<br>
The thing that was slave into slumber has passed:<br>
Now; up with the man in me! Up and be doing!<br>
No misery more! Here is freedom at last!<br>
When sudden: a whistle!&mdash;the Boss&mdash;an alarum!&mdash;<br>
I sink in the slime of the stagnant routine;&mdash;<br>
There&rsquo;s tumult, they struggle, oh, lost is my ego;&mdash;<br>
I know not, I care not, I am a machine!...</p>

<H2><a name="myboy">My Boy</a></H2>

<p>I have a little boy at home,<br>
A pretty little son;<br>
I think sometimes the world is mine<br>
In him, my only one.</p>

<p>But seldom, seldom do I see<br>
My child in heaven&rsquo;s light;<br>
I find him always fast asleep...<br>
I see him but at night.</p>

<p>Ere dawn my labor drives me forth;<br>
&rsquo;Tis night when I am free;<br>
A stranger am I to my child;<br>
And strange my child to me.</p>

<p>I come in darkness to my home,<br>
With weariness and&mdash;pay;<br>
My pallid wife, she waits to tell<br>
The things he learned to say.</p>

<p>How plain and prettily he asked:<br>
&ldquo;Dear mamma, when&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tonight&rsquo;?<br>
O when will come my dear papa<br>
And bring a penny bright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hear her words&mdash;I hasten out&mdash;<br>
This moment must it be!&mdash;<br>
The father-love flames in my breast:<br>
My child must look at me!</p>

<p>I stand beside the tiny cot,<br>
And look, and list, and&mdash;ah!<br>
A dream-thought moves the baby-lips:<br>
&ldquo;O, where is my papa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I kiss and kiss the shut blue eyes;<br>
I kiss them not in vain.<br>
They open,&mdash;O they see me then!<br>
And straightway close again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your papa, my precious one;&mdash;<br>
A penny for you!&rdquo;&mdash;ah!<br>
A dream still moves the baby-lips:<br>
&ldquo;O, where is my papa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I&mdash;I think in bitterness<br>
And disappointment sore;<br>
&ldquo;Some day you will awake, my child,<br>
To find me nevermore.&rdquo;</p>

<H2><a name="thenightingale">The Nightingale to the Workman</a></H2>

<p>Fair summer is here, glad summer is here!<br>
O hark! &rsquo;tis to you I am singing:<br>
The sun is all gold in a heaven of blue,<br>
The birds in the forest are trilling for you,<br>
The flies &rsquo;mid the grasses are winging;<br>
The little brook babbles&mdash;its secret is sweet.<br>
The loveliest flowers would circle your feet,&mdash;<br>
And you to your work ever clinging!...<br>
Come forth! Nature loves you. Come forth! Do not fear!<br>
Fair summer is here, glad summer is here,<br>
Full measure of happiness bringing.<br>
All creatures drink deep; and they pour wine anew<br>
In the old cup of life, and they wonder at you.<br>
Your portion is waiting since summer began;<br>
Then take it, oh, take it, you laboring man!</p>

<p>&rsquo;Tis summer today; ay, summer today!<br>
The butterflies light on the flowers.<br>
Delightfully glistens the silvery rain,<br>
The mountains are covered with greenness again,<br>
And perfumed and cool are the bowers.<br>
The sheep frisk about in the flowery vale,<br>
The shepherd and shepherdess pause in the dale,<br>
And these are the holiest hours!...<br>
Delay not, delay not, life passes away!<br>
&rsquo;Tis summer today, sweet summer today!<br>
Come, throttle your wheel&rsquo;s grinding power!...<br>
Your worktime is bitter and endless in length;<br>
And have you not foolishly lavished your strength?<br>
O think not the world is with bitterness rife,<br>
But drink of the wine from the goblet of life.</p>

<p>O, summer is here, sweet summer is here!<br>
I cannot forever be trilling;<br>
I flee on the morrow. Then, you, have a care!<br>
The crow, from the perch I am leaving, the air<br>
With ominous cries will be filling.<br>
O, while I am singing to you from my tree<br>
Of love, and of life, and of joy yet to be,<br>
Arouse you!&mdash;O why so unwilling!...<br>
The heavens remain not so blue and so clear;&mdash;<br>
Now summer is here! Come, summer is here!<br>
Reach out for the joys that are thrilling!<br>
For like you who fade at your wheel, day by day,<br>
Soon all things will fade and be carried away.<br>
Our lives are but moments; and sometimes the cost<br>
Of a moment o&rsquo;erlooked is eternity lost.</p>

<H2><a name="whatistheworld">What is the World?</a></H2>

<p>Well, say you the world is a chamber of sleep,<br>
And life but a sleeping and dreaming?<br>
Then I too would dream: and would joyously reap<br>
The blooms of harmonious seeming;<br>
The dream-flow&rsquo;rs of hope and of freedom, perchance,<br>
The rich are so merrily reaping;&mdash;<br>
In Love&rsquo;s eyes I&rsquo;d fancy the joy of romance;<br>
No more would I dream Love is weeping.</p>

<p>Or say you the world is a banquet, a ball,<br>
Where everyone goes who is able?<br>
I too wish to sit like a lord in the hall<br>
With savory share at the table.<br>
I too can enjoy what is wholesome and good,<br>
A morsel both dainty and healthy;<br>
I have in my body the same sort of blood<br>
That flows in the veins of the wealthy.</p>

<p>A garden you say is the world, where abound<br>
The sweetest and loveliest roses?<br>
Then would I, no leave asking, saunter around<br>
And gather me handfuls of posies.<br>
Of thorns I am sure I would make me no wreath;<br>
(Of flowers I am very much fonder).<br>
And with my beloved the bowers beneath<br>
I&rsquo;d wander, and wander, and wander.</p>

<p>But ah! if the world is a battlefield wild,<br>
Where struggle the weak with the stronger,<br>
Then heed I no storm and no wife and no child!&mdash;<br>
I stand in abeyance no longer;&mdash;<br>
Rush into the fire of the battle nor yield,<br>
And fight for my perishing brother;<br>
Well, if I am struck&mdash;I can die on the field;<br>
Die gladly as well as another....</p>

<H2><a name="despair">Despair</a></H2>

<p>No rest&mdash;not one day in the seven for me?<br>
Not one, from the maddening yoke to be free?<br>
Not one to escape from the boss on the prowl,<br>
His sinister glance and his furious growl,<br>
The cry of the foreman, the smell of the shop,&mdash;<br>
To feel for one moment the manacles drop?<br>
&mdash;<i>&rsquo;Tis rest then you want, and you fain would forget?<br>
To rest and oblivion they&rsquo;ll carry you yet.</i></p>

<p>The flow&rsquo;rs and the trees will have withered ere long,<br>
The last bird already is ending his song;<br>
And soon will be leafless and shadeless the bow&rsquo;rs...<br>
I long, oh I long for the perfume of flow&rsquo;rs!<br>
To feel for a moment ere stripped are the trees,<br>
In meadow lands open, the breath of the breeze.<br>
&mdash;<i>You long for the meadow lands breezy and fair?<br>
O, soon enough others will carry you there.</i></p>

<p>The rivulet sparkles with heavenly light,<br>
The wavelets they glisten, with diamonds bedight.<br>
Oh, but for a moment to leap in the stream,<br>
And play in the waters that ripple and gleam!<br>
My body is weakened with terrible toil.&mdash;<br>
The bath would refresh me, renew me the while.<br>
&mdash;<i>You dream of a bath in the shimmering stream?<br>
&rsquo;Twill come&mdash;when forever is ended your dream.</i></p>

<p>The sweatshop is smoky and gloomy and mean&mdash;<br>
I strive&mdash;oh, how vainly I strive to be clean!<br>
All day I am covered with grime and with dirt.<br>
You&rsquo;d laugh,&mdash;but I long for a spotless white shirt!<br>
For life that is noble, &rsquo;tis needful, I ween,<br>
To work as a man should; and still be as clean.<br>
&mdash;<i>So now &rsquo;tis your wish all in white to be dressed?<br>
In white they will robe you, and lay you to rest.</i></p>

<p>The woods they are cool, and the woods they are free;&mdash;<br>
To dream and to wander, how sweet it would be!<br>
The birds their eternal glad holiday keep;<br>
With song that enchants you and lulls you to sleep.<br>
&rsquo;Tis hot here,&mdash;and close! and the din will not cease.<br>
I long for the forest, its coolth and its peace.<br>
&mdash;<i>Ay, cool you will soon be; and not only cool,<br>
But cold as no forest can make you, O Fool!</i></p>

<p>I long for a friend who will comfort and cheer,<br>
And fill me with courage when sorrow is near;<br>
A comrade, of treasures the rarest and best,<br>
Who gives to existence its crown and its crest;<br>
And I am an orphan&mdash;and I am alone;<br>
No friend or companion to call me his own.<br>
&mdash;<i>Companions a-plenty&mdash;they&rsquo;re numberless too;<br>
They&rsquo;re swarming already and waiting for you.</i></p>

<H2><a name="whither">Whither?</a></H2>

<H3>(To a Young Girl)</H3>

<p>Say whither, whither, pretty one?<br>
The hour is young at present!<br>
How hushed is all the world around!<br>
Ere dawn&mdash;the streets hold not a sound.<br>
O whither, whither do you run?<br>
Sleep at this hour is pleasant.<br>
The flowers are dreaming, dewy-wet;<br>
The bird-nests they are silent yet.<br>
Where to, before the rising sun<br>
The world her light is giving?</p>

<p>&ldquo;To earn a living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>O whither, whither, pretty child,<br>
So late at night a-strolling?<br>
Alone&mdash;with darkness round you curled?<br>
All rests!&mdash;and sleeping is the world.<br>
Where drives you now the wind so wild?<br>
The midnight bells are tolling!<br>
Day hath not warmed you with her light;<br>
What aid can&rsquo;st hope then from the night?<br>
Night&rsquo;s deaf and blind!&mdash;Oh whither, child,<br>
Light-minded fancies weaving?</p>

<p>&ldquo;To earn a living.&rdquo;</p>

<H2><a name="fromdawntodawn">From Dawn to Dawn</a></H2>

<p>I bend o&rsquo;er the wheel at my sewing;<br>
I&rsquo;m spent; and I&rsquo;m hungry for rest;<br>
No curse on the master bestowing,&mdash;<br>
No hell-fires within me are glowing,&mdash;<br>
Tho&rsquo; pain flares its fires in my breast.</p>

<p>I mar the new cloth with my weeping,<br>
And struggle to hold back the tears;<br>
A fever comes over me, sweeping<br>
My veins; and all through me goes creeping<br>
A host of black terrors and fears.</p>

<p>The wounds of the old years ache newly;<br>
The gloom of the shop hems me in;<br>
But six o&rsquo;clock signals come duly:<br>
O, freedom seems mine again, truly...<br>
Unhindered I haste from the din.</p>

<p class="centered">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>

<p>Now home again, ailing and shaking,<br>
With tears that are blinding my eyes,<br>
With bones that are creaking and breaking,<br>
Unjoyful of rest... merely taking<br>
A seat; hoping never to rise.</p>

<p>I gaze round me: none for a greeting!<br>
By Life for the moment unpressed,<br>
My poor wife lies sleeping&mdash;and beating<br>
A lip-tune in dream false and fleeting,<br>
My child mumbles close to her breast.</p>

<p>I look on them, weeping in sorrow,<br>
And think: &ldquo;When the Reaper has come&mdash;<br>
When finds me no longer the morrow&mdash;<br>
What aid then?&mdash;from whom will they borrow<br>
The crust of dry bread and the home?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What harbors that morrow,&rdquo; I wonder,<br>
&ldquo;For them when the breadwinner&rsquo;s gone?<br>
When sudden and swift as the thunder<br>
The bread-bond is broken asunder,<br>
And friend in the world there is none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A numbness my brain is o&rsquo;ertaking...<br>
To sleep for a moment I drop:<br>
Then start!... In the east light is breaking!&mdash;<br>
I drag myself, ailing and aching,<br>
Again to the gloom of the shop.</p>

<H2><a name="thecandleseller">The Candle Seller</a></H2>

<p>In Hester Street, hard by a telegraph post,<br>
There sits a poor woman as wan as a ghost.<br>
Her pale face is shrunk, like the face of the dead,<br>
And yet you can tell that her cheeks once were red.<br>
But love, ease and friendship and glory, I ween,<br>
May hardly the cause of their fading have been.<br>
Poor soul, she has wept so, she scarcely can see.<br>
A skeleton infant she holds on her knee.<br>
It tugs at her breast, and it whimpers and sleeps,<br>
But soon at her cry it awakens and weeps&mdash;<br>
&ldquo;Two cents, my good woman, three candles will buy,<br>
As bright as their flame be my star in the sky!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tho&rsquo; few are her wares, and her basket is small,<br>
She earns her own living by these, when at all.<br>
She&rsquo;s there with her baby in wind and in rain,<br>
In frost and in snow-fall, in weakness and pain.<br>
She trades and she trades, through the good times and slack&mdash;<br>
No home and no food, and no cloak to her back.<br>
She&rsquo;s kithless and kinless&mdash;one friend at the most,<br>
And that one is silent: the telegraph post!<br>
She asks for no alms, the poor Jewess, but still,<br>
Altho&rsquo; she is wretched, forsaken and ill,<br>
She cries Sabbath candles to those that come nigh,<br>
And all that she pleads is, that people will buy.</p>

<p>To honor the sweet, holy Sabbath, each one<br>
With joy in his heart to the market has gone.<br>
To shops and to pushcarts they hurriedly fare;<br>
But who for the poor, wretched woman will care?<br>
A few of her candles you think they will take?&mdash;<br>
They seek the meat patties, the fish and the cake.<br>
She holds forth a hand with the pitiful cry:<br>
&ldquo;Two cents, my good women, three candles will buy!&rdquo;<br>
But no one has listened, and no one has heard:<br>
Her voice is so weak, that it fails at each word.<br>
Perchance the poor mite in her lap understood,<br>
She hears mother&rsquo;s crying&mdash;but where is the good</p>

<p>I pray you, how long will she sit there and cry<br>
Her candles so feebly to all that pass by?<br>
How long will it be, do you think, ere her breath<br>
Gives out in the horrible struggle with Death?<br>
How long will this frail one in mother-love strong,<br>
Give suck to the babe at her breast? Oh, how long?<br>
The child mother&rsquo;s tears used to swallow before,<br>
But mother&rsquo;s eyes, nowadays, shed them no more.<br>
Oh, dry are the eyes now, and empty the brain,<br>
The heart well-nigh broken, the breath drawn with pain.<br>
Yet ever, tho&rsquo; faintly, she calls out anew:<br>
&ldquo;Oh buy but two candles, good women, but two!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Hester Street stands on the pavement of stone<br>
A small, orphaned basket, forsaken, alone.<br>
Beside it is sitting a corpse, cold and stark:<br>
The seller of candles&mdash;will nobody mark?<br>
No, none of the passers have noticed her yet.<br>
The rich ones, on feasting are busily set,<br>
And such as are pious, you well may believe,<br>
Have no time to spare on the gay Sabbath eve.<br>
So no one has noticed and no one has seen.<br>
And now comes the nightfall, and with it, serene,<br>
The Princess, the Sabbath, from Heaven descends,<br>
And all the gay throng to the synagogue wends.</p>

<p>Within, where they pray, all is cleanly and bright,<br>
The cantor sings sweetly, they list with delight.<br>
But why in a dream stands the tall chandelier,<br>
As dim as the candles that gleam round a bier?<br>
The candles belonged to the woman, you know,<br>
Who died in the street but a short time ago.<br>
The rich and the pious have brought them tonight,<br>
For mother and child they have set them alight.<br>
The rich and the pious their duty have done:<br>
Her tapers are lighted who died all alone.<br>
The rich and the pious are nobly behaved:<br>
A body&mdash;what matters? But souls must be saved!</p>

<p>O synagogue lights, be ye witnesses bold<br>
That mother and child died of hunger and cold<br>
Where millions are squandered in idle display;<br>
That men, all unheeded, must starve by the way.<br>
Then hold back your flame, blessed lights, hold it fast!<br>
The great day of judgment will come at the last.<br>
Before the white throne, where imposture is vain,<br>
Ye lights for the soul, ye&rsquo;ll be lighted again!<br>
And upward your flame there shall mount as on wings,<br>
And damn the existing false order of things!</p>

<H2><a name="thepaleoperator">The Pale Operator</a></H2>

<p>If but with my pen I could draw him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With terror you&rsquo;d look in his face;<br>
For he, since the first day I saw him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has sat there and sewed in his place.</p>

<p>Years pass in procession unending,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever the pale one is seen,<br>
As over his work he sits bending,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fights with the soulless machine.</p>

<p>I feel, as I gaze at each feature,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perspiring and grimy and wan,<br>
It is not the strength of the creature,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The will only, urges him on.</p>

<p>And ever the sweat-drops are flowing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They fall o&rsquo;er his thin cheek in streams,<br>
They water the stuff he is sewing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And soak themselves into the seams.</p>

<p>How long shall the wheel yet, I pray you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be chased by the pale artisan?<br>
And what shall the ending be, say you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Resolve the dark riddle who can!</p>

<p>I know that it cannot be reckoned,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing the future will show:<br>
When this man has vanished, a second<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will sit in his place there and sew.</p>

<H2><a name="thebeggarfamily">The Beggar Family</a></H2>

<p>Within the court, before the judge,<br>
There stand six wretched creatures,<br>
They&rsquo;re lame and weary, one and all,<br>
With pinched and pallid features.<br>
The father is a broken man,<br>
The mother weak and ailing,<br>
The little children, skin and bone,<br>
With fear and hunger wailing.</p>

<p>Their sins are very great, and call<br>
Aloud for retribution,<br>
For their&rsquo;s (maybe you guess!) the crime<br>
Of hopeless destitution.<br>
They look upon the judge&rsquo;s face,<br>
They know what judges ponder,<br>
They know the punishment that waits<br>
On those that beg and wander.</p>

<p>For months from justice they have fled<br>
Along the streets and highways,<br>
From farm to farm, from town to town,<br>
Along the lanes and byways.<br>
They&rsquo;ve slept full oftentimes in jail,<br>
They&rsquo;re known in many places;<br>
Yet still they live, for all the woe<br>
That&rsquo;s stamped upon their faces.</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s chill with fear. The man<br>
Implores the judge: &ldquo;Oh tell us,<br>
What will you? With our children small<br>
Relentlessly expel us?<br>
Oh let us be! We&rsquo;ll sleep at night<br>
In corners dark; the city<br>
Has room for all! And some kind soul<br>
Will give a crust in pity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For wife and children I will toil:<br>
It cannot be much longer<br>
(For God almighty is and good!)<br>
Ere I for work am stronger.<br>
Oh let us here with men remain,<br>
Nor drive us any further!<br>
Oh why our curses will you have,<br>
And not our blessings rather!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now the sick man quails before<br>
The judge&rsquo;s piercing glances:<br>
&ldquo;No, only two of you shall go<br>
This time and take your chances.<br>
Your wife and you! The children four<br>
You&rsquo;ll leave, my man, behind you,<br>
For them, within the Orphan&rsquo;s Home,<br>
Free places I will find you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The father&rsquo;s dumb&mdash;the mother shrieks:<br>
&ldquo;My babes and me you&rsquo;d sever?<br>
If God there be, such cruel act<br>
Shall find forgiveness never!<br>
But first, oh judge, must you condemn<br>
To death their wretched mother&mdash;<br>
I cannot leave my children dear<br>
With you or any other!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bore and nursed them, struggling still<br>
To shelter and to shield them,<br>
Oh judge, I&rsquo;ll beg from door to door,<br>
My very life-blood yield them!<br>
I know you do not mean it, judge,<br>
With us poor folk you&rsquo;re jesting.<br>
Give back my babes, and further yet<br>
We&rsquo;ll wander unprotesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge, alas! has turned away,<br>
The paper dread unrolled,<br>
And useless all the mother&rsquo;s grief,<br>
The wild and uncontrolled.<br>
More cruel can a sentence be<br>
Than that which now is given?<br>
Oh cursed the system &rsquo;neath whose sway<br>
The human heart is riven!</p>

<H2><a name="amillionaire">A Millionaire</a></H2>

<p>No, not from tuning-forks of gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take I my key for singing;<br>
From Upper Seats no order bold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can set my music ringing;<br>
But groans the slave through sense of wrong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And naught my voice can smother;<br>
As flame leaps up, so leaps my song<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For my oppressed brother.</p>

<p>And thus the end comes swift and sure...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus life itself must leave me;<br>
For what can these my brothers poor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In compensation give me,<br>
Save tears for ev&rsquo;ry tear and sigh?&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For they are rich in anguish).<br>
A millionaire of tears am I,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And mid my millions languish.</p>

<p>The summer is over!<br>
&rsquo;Tis windy and chilly.<br>
The flowers are dead in the dale.<br>
All beauty has faded,<br>
The rose and the lily<br>
In death-sleep lie withered and pale.</p>

<p>Now hurries the stormwind<br>
A mournful procession<br>
Of leaves and dead flowers along,<br>
Now murmurs the forest<br>
Its dying confession,<br>
And hushed is the holiest song.</p>

<p>Their &ldquo;prayers of departure&rdquo;<br>
The wild birds are singing,<br>
They fly to the wide stormy main.<br>
Oh tell me, ye loved ones,<br>
Whereto are ye winging?<br>
Oh answer: when come ye again?</p>

<p>Oh hark to the wailing<br>
For joys that have vanished!<br>
The answer is heavy with pain:<br>
Alas! We know only<br>
That hence we are banished&mdash;<br>
But God knows of coming again!</p>

<p>The Tkiyes*-man has blown his horn,<br>

The leaves drop off, in fields forlorn<br>
Are tender grasses pining.</p>

<p>The earth will soon be cold and bare,<br>
Her robe of glory falling;<br>
Already to the mourner&rsquo;s prayer<br>
The last wild bird is calling.</p>

<p>He sings so sweetly and so sad<br>
A song of friends who parted,<br>
That even if it find you glad,<br>
It leaves you broken hearted.</p>

<p>The copses shudder in the breeze,<br>
Some dream-known terror fearing.<br>
Awake! O great and little trees!<br>
The Judgment-day is nearing!</p>

<p>O men! O trees in copses cold!<br>
Beware the rising weather!<br>
Or late or soon, both young and old<br>
Shall strew the ground together... .</p>

Thinking: O thou black abyss;<br>

All the struggle and the strife,<br>
Shall it come at last to this?</p>

<p>With the grave shall be requited<br>
Good and evil, and united<br>
Ne&rsquo;er to separate again?<br>

Shall the darkness join more surely?&mdash;<br>
Was the vict&rsquo;ry won in vain?</p>

Forever from the pen abstain?<br>
Good resolutions time disperses:<br>
Thou yet shalt hunger o&rsquo;er thy verses,<br>
But vainly seeking to excuse thee<br>
Because thou dost, tonight, refuse me.<br>
Then open, fool, I tell thee plain,<br>
That we perforce shall meet again.</p>

<p>Begone the way that I direct thee!<br>
I&rsquo;ve millionaires now to protect me;<br>
No need to beg, no need to borrow,<br>
Nor fear a penniless tomorrow,<br>
Nor walk with face of blackest omen<br>

Thou soon shalt be forgotten by them&mdash;<br>

To grind thy pleasures ere thou know it&mdash;<br>

<p>Now the last, long rays of sunset<br>
To the tree-tops are ascending,<br>
And the ash-gray evening shadows<br>
Weave themselves around the earth.</p>

<p>On the crest of yonder mountain,<br>
Now are seen from out the distance<br>
Slowly fading crimson traces;<br>
Footprints of the dying day.</p>

<p>Blood-stained banners, torn and tattered,<br>
Hanging in the western corner,<br>
Dip their parched and burning edges<br>
In the cooling ocean wave.</p>

<p>Smoothly roll the crystal wavelets<br>
Through the dusky veils of twilight,<br>
That are trembling down from heaven<br>
O&rsquo;er the bosom of the sea.</p>

<p>Soft a little wind is blowing<br>
O&rsquo;er the gently rippling waters&mdash;<br>
What they whisper, what they murmur,<br>
Who is wise enough to say?</p>

<p>Broad her snow-white sails outspreading<br>
&rsquo;Gainst the quiet sky of evening,<br>
Flies a ship without a sailor,<br>
Flies&mdash;and whither, who can tell?</p>

<p>As by magic moves the rudder;<br>
Borne upon her snowy pinions<br>
Flies the ship&mdash;as tho&rsquo; a spirit<br>
Drove her onward at its will!</p>

<p>Empty is she, and deserted,<br>
Only close beside the mainmast<br>
Stands a lonely child, heartbroken,<br>
Sobbing loud and bitterly.</p>

<p>Long and golden curls are falling<br>
Down his neck and o&rsquo;er his shoulders;<br>
Now he glances backward sighing,<br>
And the silent ship flies on!</p>

<p>With a little, shining kerchief,<br>
Fluttering upon the breezes,<br>
Unto me he sends a greeting,<br>
From afar he waves farewell.</p>

<p>And my heart is throbbing wildly,<br>
I am weeping&mdash;tell me wherefore?<br>
God! that lovely child, I know him!<br>

<p>Where&rsquo;er I turn, are unkind faces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hate and treachery and guile,<br>
Thou, Mis&rsquo;ry, in all times and places,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost greet me with thy pallid smile.</p>

<p>At birth I found thee waiting for me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew thee in my cradle first,<br>
The same small eyes and dim watched o&rsquo;er me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The same dry, bony fingers nursed.</p>

<p>And day by day when morning lightened,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To school thou led&rsquo;st me&mdash;home did&rsquo;st bring,<br>
And thine were all the blooms that brightened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The chilly landscape of my spring.</p>

<p>And, thou my match and marriage monger,<br>

The hands foretelling need and hunger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were laid in blessing on my head.</p>

My hopes for aye were from me taken,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Above me, and my head I bow&mdash;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Mis&rsquo;ry, thou art with me now.</p>

<p>Ay, still from out Fate&rsquo;s gloomy towers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I see thee come to me again,<br>
With wreaths of everlasting flowers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And songs funereal in thy train.</p>

<p>And when life&rsquo;s curses rock me nightly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hushed I lie in slumber&rsquo;s hold,<br>
Thy sable form comes treading lightly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap me in its garments fold.</p>

<p>There stands in th&rsquo; leafless Ghetto<br>
One spare-leaved, ancient tree;<br>
Above the Ghetto noises<br>
It moans eternally.</p>

<p>In wonderment it muses,<br>
And murmurs with a sigh:<br>
&ldquo;Alas! how God-forsaken<br>
And desolate am I!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, the stony alleys,<br>
And noises loud and bold!<br>
Where are ye, birds of summer?<br>
Where are ye, woods of old?</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where, ye breezes balmy<br>
That wandered vagrant here?<br>
And where, oh sweep of heavens<br>
So deep and blue and clear?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are ye, mighty giants?<br>
Ye come not riding by<br>
Upon your fiery horses,<br>
A-whistling merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of other days my dreaming,<br>
Of other days, ah me!<br>
When sturdy hero-races<br>
Lived wild and glad and free!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old sun shone, how brightly!<br>
The old lark sang, what song!<br>
O&rsquo;er earth Desire and Gladness<br>
Reigned happily and long</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see! what are these ant-hills?&mdash;<br>
These ants that creep and crawl?...<br>
Bereft of man and nature,<br>
My life is stripped of all!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I, an ancient orphan,<br>
What do I here alone?<br>
My friends have all departed,<br>
My youth and glory gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tear me, root and branches!<br>
No longer let me be<br>
A living head-stone, brooding<br>
O&rsquo;er the grave of liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<H2><a name="thecemeterynightingale">The Cemetery Nightingale</a></H2>

<p>In the hills&rsquo; embraces holden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a valley filled with glooms,<br>
Lies a cemetery olden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strewn with countless mould&rsquo;ring tombs.</p>

<p>Ancient graves o&rsquo;erhung with mosses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Crumbling stones, effaced and green,&mdash;<br>
Venturesome is he who crosses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Night or day, the lonely scene.</p>

<p>Blasted trees and willow streamers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Midst the terror round them spread,<br>
Seem like awe-bound, silent dreamers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this garden of the dead.</p>

<p>One bird, anguish stricken, lingers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shadow of the vale,<br>
First and best of feathered singers,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the churchyard nightingale.</p>

<p>As from bough to bough he flutters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetest songs of woe and wail<br>
Through his gift divine he utters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the dreamers in the vale.</p>

<p>Listen how his trills awaken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Echoes from each mossy stone!<br>
Of all places he has taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s still Acre for his own.</p>

<p class="centered">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>

<p>Not on Spring or Summer glory,<br>
Not on god or angel story<br>
Loyal poet-fancy dwells!<br>
Not on streams for rich men flowing,<br>
Not on fields for rich men&rsquo;s mowing,&mdash;<br>
Graves he sees, of graves he tells.<br>
Pain, oppression, woe eternal,<br>
Open heart-wounds deep, diurnal,<br>
Nothing comforts or allays;<br>
O&rsquo;er God&rsquo;s Acre in each nation<br>
Sings he songs of tribulation<br>
Tunes his golden harp and plays.</p>

<H2><a name="thecreationofman">The Creation Of Man</a></H2>

<p>When the world was first created<br>
By th&rsquo; all-wise Eternal One,<br>
Asked he none for help or counsel,&mdash;<br>
Simply spake, and it was done!</p>

<p>Made it for his own good pleasure,<br>
Shaped it on his own design,<br>
Spent a long day&rsquo;s work upon it,<br>
Formed it fair and very fine.</p>

<p>Soon he thought on man&rsquo;s creation,&mdash;<br>
Then perplexities arose,<br>
So the Lord His winged Senate<br>
Called, the question to propose:</p>

<p>Hear, my great ones, why I called ye,<br>
Hear and help me ye who can,<br>
Hear and tell me how I further<br>
Shall proceed in making man.</p>

<p>Ponder well before ye answer,<br>
And consider, children dear;&mdash;<br>
In our image I would make him,<br>
Free from stain, from blemish clear.</p>

<p>Of my holy fire I&rsquo;d give him,<br>
Crowned monarch shall he be,<br>
Ruling with a sway unquestioned<br>
Over earth and air and sea.</p>

<p>Birds across the blue sky winging<br>
Swift shall fly before his face,&mdash;<br>
Silver fishes in the ocean,<br>
Savage lion in the chase.</p>

<p>&mdash;How? This toy of froth and vapor,<br>
Thought the Senate, filled with fear,<br>
If so wide his kingdom stretches,<br>
Shortly he will break in here!</p>

<p>So the Lord they answered, saying:&mdash;<br>
Mind and strength Thy creature give,<br>
Form him in our very image,<br>
Lord, but wingless let him live!</p>

<p>Lest he shame the soaring eagle<br>
Let no wings to man be giv&rsquo;n,<br>
Bid him o&rsquo;er the earth be ruler,<br>
Lord, but keep him out of heav&rsquo;n!</p>

<p>Wisely said, the Lord made answer,<br>
Lo, your counsel fair I take!<br>
Yet, my Senate, one exception&mdash;<br>
One alone, I will to make.</p>

<p>One exception! for the poet,<br>
For the singer, shall have wings;<br>
He the gates of Heav&rsquo;n shall enter,<br>
Highest of created things.</p>

<p>One I single from among ye,<br>
One to watch the ages long,<br>
Promptly to admit the poet<br>
When he hears his holy song.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The pen that shall not tire!</p>

<p>The pen, that was my humble slave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Has now enslaved its master;<br>
And fast as flows its Midas-wave,<br>

<p>Pale-faced is he, as in the door<br>

And says: &ldquo;Dear editor,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since write you must, in prose or rhyme,<br>
Expose my master&rsquo;s knavery,<br>
Condemn, I pray, the slavery<br>
That dominates our time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I labor for a wicked man<br>
Who holds o&rsquo;er all my being sway,&mdash;<br>
Who keeps me harnessed night and day.<br>
Since work I first began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No leisure moments do I store,<br>
Yet harsh words only will he speak;<br>
My days are his, from week to week,<br>
But still he cries for more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh print, I beg you, all I&rsquo;ve said,<br>
And ask the world if this be right:<br>
To give the worker wage so slight<br>
That he must want for bread.</p>

Yet may not use them at my will,<br>

<p>&ldquo;But oh, without avail do I<br>
Lay bare the woes of workingmen!<br>
Who earns his living by the pen,<br>
Feels not our misery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pallid slave yet paler grew,<br>
And ended here his bitter cry...<br>
And thus to him I made reply:<br>
&ldquo;My friend, you judge untrue.</p>

<H2><a name="thejewishmay">The Jewish May</a></H2>

<p>May has come from out the showers,<br>
Sun and splendor in her train.<br>
All the grasses and the flowers<br>
Waken up to life again.<br>
Once again the leaves do show,<br>
And the meadow blossoms blow,<br>
Once again through hills and dales<br>
Rise the songs of nightingales.</p>

<p>Wheresoe&rsquo;er on field or hillside<br>
With her paint-brush Spring is seen,&mdash;<br>
In the valley, by the rillside,<br>
All the earth is decked with green.<br>
Once again the sun beguiles<br>
Moves the drowsy world to smiles.<br>
See! the sun, with mother-kiss<br>
Wakes her child to joy and bliss.</p>

<p>Now each human feeling presses<br>
Flow&rsquo;r like, upward to the sun,<br>
Softly, through the heart&rsquo;s recesses,<br>
Steal sweet fancies, one by one.<br>
Golden dreams, their wings outshaking,<br>
Now are making<br>
Realms celestial,<br>
All of azure,<br>
New life waking,<br>
Bringing treasure<br>
Out of measure<br>
For the soul&rsquo;s delight and pleasure.</p>

<p>Who then, tell me, old and sad,<br>
Nears us with a heavy tread?<br>
On the sward in verdure clad,<br>
Lonely is the strange newcomer,<br>
Wearily he walks and slow,&mdash;<br>
His sweet springtime and his summer<br>
Faded long and long ago!</p>

<p>Say, who is it yonder walks<br>
Past the hedgerows decked anew,<br>
While a fearful spectre stalks<br>
By his side the woodland through?<br>
&rsquo;Tis our ancient friend the Jew!<br>
No sweet fancies hover round him,<br>
Naught but terror and distress.<br>
Wounds unhealed<br>
Where lie revealed<br>
Ghosts of former recollections,<br>
Corpses, corpses, old affections,<br>
Buried youth and happiness.</p>

<p>Brier and blossom bow to meet him<br>
In derision round his path;<br>
Gloomily the hemlocks greet him<br>
And the crow screams out in wrath.<br>
Strange the birds and strange the flowers,<br>
Strange the sunshine seems and dim,<br>
Folk on earth and heav&rsquo;nly powers!&mdash;<br>
Lo, the May is strange to him!</p>

<p>Little flowers, it were meeter<br>
If ye made not quite so bold:<br>
Sweet ye are, but oh, far sweeter<br>
Knew he in the days of old!<br>
Oranges by thousands glowing<br>
Filled his groves on either hand,&mdash;<br>
All the plants were God&rsquo;s own sowing<br>
In his happy, far-off land!</p>

<p>Ask the cedars on the mountain!<br>
Ask them, for they know him well!<br>
Myrtles green by Sharon&rsquo;s fountain,<br>
In whose shade he loved to dwell!<br>
Ask the Mount of Olives beauteous,&mdash;<br>
Ev&rsquo;ry tree by ev&rsquo;ry stream!&mdash;<br>
One and all will answer duteous<br>
For the fair and ancient dream....</p>

<p>O&rsquo;er the desert and the pleasance<br>
Gales of Eden softly blew,<br>
And the Lord His loving Presence<br>
Evermore declared anew.<br>
Angel children at their leisure<br>
Played in thousands round His tent,<br>
Countless thoughts of joy and pleasure<br>
God to His beloved sent.</p>

<p>There in bygone days and olden,<br>
From a wond&rsquo;rous harp and golden<br>
Charmed he music spirit-haunting,<br>
Holy, chaste and soul-enchanting.<br>
Never with the ancient sweetness,<br>
Never in its old completeness<br>
Shall it sound: his dream is ended,<br>
On a willow-bough suspended.</p>

<p>Gone that dream so fair and fleeting!<br>
Yet behold: thou dreamst anew!<br>
Hark! a <i>new</i> May gives thee greeting<br>
From afar. Dost hear it, Jew?<br>
Weep no more, altho&rsquo; with sorrows<br>
Bow&rsquo;d e&rsquo;en to the grave: I see<br>
Happier years and brighter morrows,<br>
Dawning, Israel, for thee!<br>
Hear&rsquo;st thou not the promise ring<br>
Where, like doves on silver wing,<br>
Thronging cherubs sweetly sing<br>
Newmade songs of what shall be?</p>

<p>Hark! your olives shall be shaken,<br>
And your citrons and your limes<br>
Filled with fragrance. God shall waken.<br>
Lead you as in olden times.<br>
In the pastures by the river<br>
Ye once more your flocks shall tend.<br>
Ye shall live, and live forever<br>
Happy lives that know no end.<br>
No more wandering, no more sadness:<br>
Peace shall be your lot, and still<br>
Hero hearts shall throb with gladness<br>
&rsquo;Neath Moriah&rsquo;s silent hill.<br>
Nevermore of dread afflictions<br>
Or oppression need ye tell:<br>
Filled with joy and benedictions<br>
In the old home shall ye dwell.<br>
To the fatherland returning,<br>
Following the homeward path,<br>
Ye shall find the embers burning<br>
Still upon the ruined hearth!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To laughing with me,&mdash;not a word for reply!<br>
You see, it is Sf&#x0113;r&eacute;, our time for dejection,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And can a Jew laugh when the rule is to cry?</p>

<p>You laughed then, you say? &rsquo;tis a sound to affright one!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Jewish delight, what is worthy the name?<br>
The laugh of a Jew! It is never a right one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For laughing and groaning with him are the same.</p>

<p>You thought there was zest in a Jewish existence?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You deemd that the star of a Jew could be kind?<br>
The Spring calls and beckons with gracious insistence,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jew,&mdash;sit down in sackcloth and weep yourself blind!</p>

<p>The garden is green and the woodland rejoices:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How cool are the breezes, with fragrance how blent!<br>
But Spring calls not <i>you</i> with her thousand sweet voices!&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With you it is Sf&#x0113;r&eacute;,&mdash;sit still and lament!</p>

<p>The beautiful summer, this life&rsquo;s consolation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In moaning and sighing glides quickly away.<br>
What hope can it offer to one of my nation?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What joy can he find in the splendors of May?</p>

<p>Bewildered and homeless, of whom whoso passes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May fearlessly stop to make sport at his ease,&mdash;<br>
Say, is it for him to seek flowers and grasses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For him to be thinking on meadows and trees?</p>

<p>And if for a moment, forgetting to ponder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On grief and oppression, song breaks out anew,<br>
I hear in his lay only: &ldquo;Wander and wander!&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ev&rsquo;ry note tells me the singer&rsquo;s a Jew.</p>

<p>A skilful musician, and one who is versd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In metre and measure, whenever he hears<br>
The pitiful song of the Jewish dispersd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It touches his heart and it moves him to tears.</p>

<p>The blast of the Ram&rsquo;s-horn that quavers and trembles,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On this, now, alone Jewish fancy is bent.<br>
To grief and contrition its host it assembles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And causes the stoniest heart to relent.</p>

<p>The wail that went up when the Temple was shattered,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The song of Atonement, the Suppliant&rsquo;s psalm,&mdash;<br>
These only he loves, since they took him&mdash;and scattered,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from the land of the balsam and balm.</p>

<p>Of all the sweet instruments, shiver&rsquo;d and broken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That once in the Temple delighted his ear,<br>
The Ram&rsquo;s-horn alone has he kept, as a token,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sobs out his soul on it once in the year.</p>

<p>Instead of the harp and the viol and cymbal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of the lyre, the guitar and the flute,<br>
He has but the dry, wither&rsquo;d Ram&rsquo;s-horn, the symbol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of gloom and despondence; the rest all are mute.</p>

<p>He laughs, or he breaks into song, but soon after,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho&rsquo; fain would he take in man&rsquo;s gladness a part,<br>
One hears, low resounding athwart the gay laughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Suppliant&rsquo;s psalm, and it pierces the heart.</p>

<p>I asked of my Muse, had she any objection<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To laughing with me,&mdash;not a word for reply!<br>

Friend, these are your hopes and your longings unspoken!</p>

<p>Lo, there lie your dreamings all dimm&rsquo;d and rejected,<br>
And there lie the joys were so surely expected!<br>
And there is the happiness blighted and perished,<br>
And all that aforetime your soul knew and cherished,<br>
The loved and the longed for, the striven for vainly&mdash;<br>
Your whole life before you lies pictured how plainly!</p>

<p>The branches are sapless, the leaves will decay,<br>
An end is upon us, and whence, who shall say?<br>
The broom of the beadle outside now has hustled<br>
The lime and the palm that so pleasantly rustled.<br>
There blew a cold gust, from our sight all is banished&mdash;<br>
The shaft from a cross-bow less swiftly had vanished!</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
